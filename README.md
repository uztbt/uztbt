## Hi, I'm Yuji 👋

2020 is my third year as a professional software engineer specializing in IoT solutions.

I really want to get back the communities heavily damaged by the covid-19.

So, if you are working on a project relating to that matter, please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuji-tabata-76692018b/).

### YouTube

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiO95Tufp1g0TtD9Q-xgw4A?view_as=subscriber) to record my hobby projects.

I list some of them here.
